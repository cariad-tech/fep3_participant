System Scope and Context
========================

System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits the FEP SDK Participant Library (i.e. your scope) from all its 
communication partners (neighbouring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

Details of the overall FEP SDK architecture (incl. business and technical context) can be found in `Architecture Definition Documentation FEP SDK <https://devstack.vwgroup.com/confluence/x/ZkgMTw>`_.

In addition to that the technical context of the FEP SDK Participant Library is shown in the following diagram. 
It describes the relationships and interfaces of the FEP SDK Participant Library to neighbouring systems.
